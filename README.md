## About exam-app

This is an online exam platform that allows teachers and students to create accounts. Teachers can create subjects and a subject can have topics with different questions. A question is of an open (essay) or closed (multiple choice) type. When exams are created, a question can be reused in multiple exams. Teachers can add students to their subjects to test them. Furthermore teachers can add other teachers to their subject, to assist them. A session can be started by a teacher, where a selected exam is used to test selected students. The application asseses closed questions automatically, and answers to open questions are manually graded by teachers.
